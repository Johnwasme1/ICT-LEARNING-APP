                    <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong></p>
                    <p>Personal protective equipment (PPE) refers to protective clothing, helmets, goggles, or other garments designed to protect the wearer's body from injury by blunt impacts, electrical hazards, heat, chemicals, and infection, for job-related occupational safety and health purposes, and in sports, martial arts, combat, etc.</p>
                
                    <p>To protect anyone from danger by working any electrical activities, protective equipment such as safety shoes, goggles, hard hats, and gloves are issued. The use of this equipment is mandatory on certain activities. Their use is a MUST, and there is no question about that. Be sure to USE THEM on any designated activity WHERE they are REQUIRED. They can protect you from a lot of harm.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Importance of Personal Protective Equipment:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The type of personal protective equipment (PPE) needed when using hand tools depends on the nature of the task. At a minimum, eye protection should always be worn.</li>
                        <li>The use of hand protection may also be appropriate to provide protection against cuts, abrasion, and repeated impact.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <p>The purpose of personal protective equipment is to reduce exposure to hazards.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Categories of Personal Protective Equipment:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Eye and Face Protection:</strong> This will be used to avoid being exposed to a large number of hazards that pose danger to their eyes and face. Then to ensure that workers have appropriate eye or face protection if they are exposed to eye or face hazards from flying particles, molten metal, liquid chemicals, acids or caustic liquids, chemical gases or vapors, potentially infected material or potentially harmful light radiation.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Safety spectacles. These protective eyeglasses have safety frames constructed of metal or plastic and impact-resistant lenses. Side shields are available on some models.</li>
                                <li>Goggles. These are tight-fitting eye protection that completely cover the eyes, eye sockets and the facial area immediately surrounding the eyes and provide protection from impact, dust, and splashes. Some goggles will fit over corrective lenses.</li>
                                <li>Face shields. These shields protect against nuisance dusts and potential splashes or sprays of hazardous liquids but will not provide adequate protection against impact hazards. Face shields used in combination with goggles or safety spectacles will provide additional protection against impact hazards.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Foot and Leg Protection:</strong> Used for possible foot or leg injuries from the Moist floors, Non-grounded Power Extension cables and Power Surge that you might get serious injuries.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Safety shoes: Safety shoes to be used electrically conductive to prevent the buildup of static electricity in areas with the potential for explosive atmospheres or nonconductive to protect workers from workplace electrical hazards.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Hand and Arm Protection:</strong> If a workplace hazard assessment reveals that workers face potential injury to hands and arms that cannot be eliminated through work activity and practice controls. Working Gloves with a plastic rubber is one of the examples of Hand and Arm Protection Equipment's that are usually used in any electrical working activities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Body Protection:</strong> This is used to protect possible bodily injury in the workplace. Workers must wear appropriate body protection while performing their jobs. In addition to cuts and radiation, it avoids some electrical charge leaks that cannot be eliminated.</li>
                    </ol>
                
                    <p><strong>Personal Protective Equipment includes:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Safety Precautions</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Preventive Maintenance</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Protective Devices</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Accident Reports</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                
                    <p><strong>Safety precautions:</strong></p>
                    <p>Proper preparation is the key to a successful build. Before you begin, make sure that you have the tools you will need and secure a clear well-lit workplace. Gather all the components you'll be using and unpack them at the same time. Find a dry, well-ventilated place to do your work, you should choose an area without carpets, because it tends to create static electricity. Always keep in mind that personal protection is one of the traits of a good technician.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Preventive Maintenance:</strong></p>
                    <p>Maintenance is keeping something in working order. It includes repair, testing, adjusting, and replacing parts of a computer or a peripheral.</p>
                    <p><strong>Types of Maintenance</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Active</li>
                        <li>Passive</li>
                    </ul>
            
                        <p><strong>Anti-Static devices:</strong> These are the devices used to protect computer units from electrostatic discharge.</p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Anti-static Wrist Strap:</strong> Also known as ESD wrist strap or ground bracelet, it is an antistatic device used to safely ground a person working on very sensitive electronic equipment, to prevent the buildup of static electricity on their body, which can result in electrostatic discharge (ESD).</li>
                            <li><strong>Anti-static Mat:</strong> An antistatic floor mat or ground mat is one of a number of antistatic devices designed to help eliminate static electricity. It does this by having a controlled low resistance: a metal mat would keep parts grounded but would short out exposed parts; an insulating mat would provide no ground reference and so would not provide grounding.</li>
                            <li><strong>Anti-static Bag:</strong> It is a bag used for shipping (usually electronic) components, which are prone to damage caused by electrostatic discharge.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <p>An electrostatic-sensitive device (ESD) is any component which can be damaged by common static charges which build up on people, tools, and other non-conductors or semiconductors. ESD commonly also stands for electrostatic discharge. As electronic parts like computer central processing units (CPUs) become packed more and more densely with transistors the transistors shrink and become more and more vulnerable to ESD.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong>Power Surge Protector Devices:</strong> These are designed to protect electrical devices from voltage spikes. A surge protector attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or by shorting to ground any unwanted voltages above a safe threshold.</p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Automatic Voltage Regulators (AVR):</strong> These are designed to automatically maintain a constant voltage level. A voltage regulator may be a simple "feed-forward" design or may include negative feedback control loops. It may use an electromechanical mechanism, or electronic components. Depending on the design, it may be used to regulate one or more AC or DC voltages.</li>
                            <li><strong>Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS):</strong> This is an electrical apparatus that provides emergency power to a load when the input power source, typically mains power, fails. A UPS differs from an auxiliary or emergency power system or standby generator in that it will provide near-instantaneous protection from input power interruptions, by supplying energy stored in batteries, super capacitors, or flywheels. The on-battery runtime of most uninterruptible power sources is relatively short (only a few minutes) but sufficient to start a standby power source or properly shut down the protected equipment. A UPS is typically used to protect hardware such as computers, data centers, telecommunication equipment or other electrical equipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious business disruption or data loss.</li>

             <li><strong>Mouse:</strong> A device that enables a user to point at or select items that are shown on the screen.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The following are the additional components of a PC system. This means that an already fully-functional PC system can stand on its own even without these components.</p>
            <ul>
          <li><strong>CD-ROM, CD-R, or DVD-ROM Drive:</strong> CD- (Compact Disc) and DVD- (Digital Versatile Disc) ROM (Read Only Memory) drives are relatively high capacity removable media optical drives.</li>
              <li><strong>Floppy Drive:</strong> A simple, inexpensive, low capacity removable media magnetic storage device.</li>
          <li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> Today's PC audio hardware usually takes the form of an audio adapter on an expansion card that you install into a bus slot in the computer.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>MICROPROCESSOR AND ITS PROCESSES</strong></p>
            <ul>
             <li><strong>Fetch:</strong> Retrieves an instruction from program memory.</li>
         <li><strong>Decode:</strong> CPU fetches from memory is used to determine what the CPU will be doing. In the decode step, the instruction is broken up into parts for processing.</li>
         <li><strong>Execute:</strong> Various portions of the CPU are connected so they can perform the desired operation.</li>
             <li><strong>Writeback:</strong> Returns the results of the execute step to memory.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Peripheral Devices</strong></p>
            <p>A peripheral is a type of computer hardware that is added to a host computer in order to expand its abilities. More specifically, the term is used to describe those devices that are optional in nature, as opposed to hardware that is either demanded, or always required in principle.</p>
            <p>The term also tends to be applied to devices that are hooked up externally, typically through some form of computer bus like USB. Typical examples include joysticks, printers, and scanners. Devices such as monitors and disk drives are not considered peripherals because they are not truly optional, and video capture cards are typically not referred to as peripherals because they are internal devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Printers</strong></p>
            <p>A computer printer is a computer peripheral device that produces a hard copy (permanent human-readable text and/or graphics, usually on paper) from data stored in a computer connected to it.</p>

            <p><strong>Scanners</strong></p>
            <p>A scanner is a device that analyzes a physical image (such as a photograph, printed text, or handwriting) or an object (such as ornament) and converts it to a digital image.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Casing:</strong> A computer case contains the framework to support a computer's internal components while providing an enclosure for added protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> The power supply converts alternating-current (AC) power coming from a wall outlet into direct-current (DC) power, which is a lower voltage.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>3. Motherboard </strong> The motherboard is the main printed circuit board. It contains the buses, or electrical pathways, found in a computer. These buses allow data to travel between the various components that comprise a computer. A motherboard is also known as the system board, backplane, or main board.</p>
                <p>The motherboard accommodates the central processing unit (CPU), RAM, expansion slots, heat sink/fan assembly, BIOS chip, chip set, and the embedded wires that interconnect the motherboard components. Sockets, internal and external connectors, and various ports are also placed on the motherboard.</p>
                <p>The form factor of motherboards pertains to the board's size and shape. It also describes the physical layout of the different components and devices on the motherboard. Motherboards have various form factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Technology (AT)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Technology Extended (ATX)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Smaller footprint than Advanced Technology Extended (Mini-ATX)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Smaller footprint than Advanced Technology Extended (Micro-ATX)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Low-Profile Extended (LPX)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>New Low-Profile Extended (NLX)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Balanced technology Extended (BTX)</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>An important set of components on the motherboard is the chip set. The chip set is composed of various integrated circuits attached to the motherboard that control how system hardware interacts with the CPU and motherboard. The CPU is installed into a slot or socket on the motherboard. The socket on the motherboard determines the type of CPU that can be installed.</p>
                <p>The chip set of a motherboard allows the CPU to communicate and interact with the computer's other components and to exchange data with system memory (RAM), hard-disk drives, video cards, and other output devices. The chip set establishes how much memory can be added to a motherboard. The chip set also determines the type of connectors on the motherboard.</p>
                <p>Most chip sets are divided into two distinct components, Northbridge and Southbridge. What each component does varies from manufacturer to manufacturer, but in general the Northbridge controls access to the RAM, video card, and the speeds at which the CPU can communicate with them. The video card is sometimes integrated into the Northbridge. The Southbridge, in most cases, allows the CPU to communicate with the hard drives, sound card, USB ports, and other input/output (I/O) ports.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Central Processing Unit -</strong> The central processing unit (CPU) is considered the computer’s brain. It is sometimes called the processor. Most calculations take place in the CPU. In terms of computing power, the CPU is the most important element of a computer system. CPUs come in different form factors, each style requiring a particular slot or socket on the motherboard. Common CPU manufacturers include Intel and AMD.</p>

                <p><strong>The CPU socket or slot</strong> is the connector that is the interface between the motherboard and the processor. Most CPU sockets and processors in use today are built around the pin grid array (PGA) architecture, in which the pins on the underside of the processor are inserted into the socket, usually with zero insertion force (ZIF). ZIF refers to the amount of force needed to install a CPU into the motherboard socket or slot. Slot-based processors are cartridge-shaped and fit into a slot that looks similar to an expansion slot.</p>
                </ul>
              <p>The latest processor technology has caused CPU manufacturers to find ways to incorporate more than one CPU core into a single chip. Many CPUs can process multiple instructions concurrently:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Single-core CPU:</strong> One core inside a single CPU chip that handles all the processing capability. A motherboard manufacturer may provide sockets for more than a single processor, providing the ability to build a powerful multiprocessor computer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dual-core CPU:</strong> Two cores inside a single CPU chip, in which both cores can process information at the same time.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>5. Cooling System</strong>  Electronic components generate heat. Heat is caused by the flow of current within the components. Computer components perform better when kept cool. If the heat is not removed, the computer may run slower. If too much heat builds up, computer components can be damaged. Increasing the airflow in the computer case allows more heat to be removed. A case fan is installed in the computer case to make the cooling process more efficient.</p>
                <p>In addition to case fans, a heat sink draws heat away from the core of the CPU. A fan on top of the heat sink moves the heat away from the CPU.</p>
                <p>Other components are also susceptible to heat damage and sometimes are equipped with fans. Video adapter cards produce a great deal of heat system. A metal plate is placed over the processor, and water is pumped over the top to collect the heat that the CPU creates. The water is pumped to a radiator to be cooled by the air and then is recirculated.</p>

                <p><strong>6. ROM and RAM</strong>  ROM and RAM provide memory for a vast amount of computer equipment. They come in different memory sizes and module sizes and have different features.</p>
                <p><strong>ROM (Read-only Memory)</strong> - chips are located on the motherboard. ROM chips contain instructions that the CPU can access directly.</p>

            <h2>Learning Outcome No.3: Install operating system and drivers for peripherals/ devices </h2>
                <p><strong>Steps in Installing Operating System</strong></p>
                <h3>WHAT IS AN OPERATING SYSTEM?</h3>
                <p><strong>An operating system (OS)</strong> is a program or set of instructions that act as an interface between the user and the computer hardware. It manages the computer’s memory, processes, and all of its software and hardware.</p>

                <h3>FUNCTIONS OF OPERATING SYSTEM</h3>
                        <p><strong>1. PROVIDING USER INTERFACE</strong></p>
                    
                     <strong>a. Graphical User Interface (GUI)</strong>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Most common GUI are Windows, OS X, Gnome, KDE.</li>
                         <li>Uses a mouse to work with graphical objects such as windows menu, icons, buttons, and other tools.</li>
                         <li>Uses desktop as metaphor.</li>
                     </ul>
    
                     <strong>b. Command Line Interface (CLI)</strong>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Older interfaces such as DOS, Linux, UNIX use typewritten commands rather than graphical objects to execute tasks.</li>
                     </ul>
                 </li>
             </ol>
         </li>

             <p><strong>2. RUNNING PROGRAMS</strong></p>
             <ul>
                 <li>Many different software applications supported.</li>
                 <li>System calls provide consistent access to OS features.</li>
                 <li>Share information between programs:
                     <ul>

             </ul>

 
             <p><strong>3. MANAGING HARDWARE</strong></p>
             <ul>
                 <li>The Operating System acts as an intermediary between programs and hardware.</li>
                 <li>The OS uses interrupt requests (IRQs) to help the CPU coordinates.</li>
                 <li>Device driver controls the hardware.</li>
             </ul>


             <p><strong>4. ORGANIZING FILES AND FOLDERS</strong></p>
